# Getting started

First thing you have to do is set up config files for credentials <br>
Use the credentials for the 3rd party authenticator to log in. In desired directory, execute
<br>

```mkdir .work && touch .work/config.txt```

<br>

In your favorite editor, open up .work/config.txt, and the lines go as follow: <br>
```calnet username <br>
calnet password <br>
pyke13 email <br>
pyke13 pwd <br>
```
<br>

Run program by running
<br>

```py ./build/bc.py```

<br>

Will update readme with more info one I finish up and school slows down some for me
